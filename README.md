# jQuery Equal Heights

A script to "equalize" the heights of boxes within the same container and create
a tidy grid

## Fork
* Originally by Bryan Powell.
* Adapted by Greg Turner to work on elements, not their children, and to take
  into account borders and padding.
* Added to by Mark Finger to include `equalHeightsByHClass` which groups
  elements together by a `h-class` attribute, then equalises the heights of
  each group of elements.
* Added jQuery namespace wrapper by Dave Hansen-Lange.
